*Using iPhone7 with iOS 14.8*

### checkra1n
1. download checkra1n (0.12.4)
1. **preffered** Use Ubuntu (with X and NOT Wayland) - OR - use **INTEL** based macOS or older macOS - latest (2022) doesn't work with Apple M1 at least :[
1. use following settings: ![testing](cr.png)

Problem solving:
* If this doesn't work (exploit does not trigger) - reset iPhone using `erase all content -> everything`. Repeat.
* If Cydia / apt fails - remove from system and rearm using checkra1n
